How many times you sit on your couch and has no idea what to watch and end up scrolling Nexflix endlessly?

Well, scroll no more!

This app will let you mark your favorite movies and tv shows from your streaming subscription, and when your partner likes the same movie you will have a MATCH!
That will create a shared list with all the things you both like, and reduce the time to decide what to watch next time you both have some time to relax.

It's like a Tinder, but for movies!
